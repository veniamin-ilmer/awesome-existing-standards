# Standards Research

From time to time, I wonder: Is this the best standard?

Is there a better way to do whatever I am doing?

I then do tons of research and get the best solution.

Transfering to the best solution may be too costly, but it's good to acknowledge the solution nonetheless.

Below are a list of standards I have researched, what are the alternatives.

All standards are listed, based on my opinion, from best to worst.

Top and worst qualities will be limited to just three for each.

## [Bottle and Metal Can Design](bottle-design.md)

**Best Standard**: Cylinder

**Alternative Standards**: Cube, Hexagonal Prism, Sphere

## [Electric Plug](electric-plug.md)
