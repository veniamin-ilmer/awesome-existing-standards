# Standards Research

From time to time, I wonder: Is this the best standard?

Is there a better way to do whatever I am doing?

I then do tons of research and get the best solution.

Transfering to the best solution may be too costly, but it's good to acknowledge the solution nonetheless.

Below are a list of standards I have researched, what are the alternatives. Click to get a detailed table of benefits for each standard.
