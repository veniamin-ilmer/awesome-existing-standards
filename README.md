# Standards Research

From time to time, I wonder: Is this the best standard?

Is there a better way to do whatever I am doing?

I then do tons of research and get the best solution.

Transfering to the best solution may be too costly, but it's good to acknowledge the solution nonetheless.

Below are a list of standards I have researched, what are the alternatives.

All standards are listed, based on my opinion, from best to worst.

Top and worst qualities will be limited to just three for each.

## Bottle and Metal Can Design

### Cylinder

**Best Qualities**:

* Inexpensive to manufacture.
* Relatively high packing volume / surface area ratio.
* Practical to hold or place on table.

**Worst Qualities**:

* Requires more material than a sphere design.
* Slightly worst packing ratio than cube/hexagon.

### Cube or Hexagonal Prism

**Best Qualities**: 

* Practical to hold or place on table.
* Highest possible packing volume / surface area ratio.
* Relatively inexpensive to manufacture.

**Worst Quality**: 

* The edges are very weak points, and can easily break.
* Significantly more metal required than a sphere or cylinder design, for stability.

### Sphere

**Best Qualities**: 

* Most efficient quantity of material used, per surface area.
* No edges, hence no weak points.

**Worst Quality**: 

* Impractical to hold or place on table.
* Expensive to manufacture.
* Low packing volume / surface area ratio.
