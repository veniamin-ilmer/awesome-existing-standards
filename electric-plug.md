# Electric Plug

**Ground First**: Ground / Earth is the first metal to touch when connecting the cable, and the last metal to leave when disconnection the cable.

**Insulated Pins**: Pins have insulation at their base, so you can't accidently touch the metal when it is connected half way.

**Blocking shutters**: Stops children from sticking fingers into exposed holes.

**Fused**: There is literally a fuse inside of the plug. You can unscrew the plug and replace the fuse.
