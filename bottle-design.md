# Bottle and Metal Can Design

**Cost**: Bulk manufacturing price.

**Easy to hold/stand**: Easy to drink from and hold. Will stay in place if you put it on a table.

**Weak Points**: Locations where the bottle/can could easily break. Usually this happens at edges.

**Packing Volume**: How many cans/bottles can you stack together at once.

**Inside Volume**: How much liquid you can fill inside vs the amount of material required to hold it.
