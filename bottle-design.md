# Bottle and Metal Can Design

## Cylinder

### Best Qualities

* Inexpensive to manufacture.
* Relatively high packing volume / surface area ratio.
* Practical to hold or place on table.

### Worst Qualities

* Requires more material than a sphere design.
* Slightly worst packing ratio than cube/hexagon.

## Cube or Hexagonal Prism

### Best Qualities

* Practical to hold or place on table.
* Highest possible packing volume / surface area ratio.
* Relatively inexpensive to manufacture.

### Worst Qualities

* The edges are very weak points, and can easily break.
* Significantly more metal required than a sphere or cylinder design, for stability.

## Sphere

### Best Qualities

* Most efficient quantity of material used, per surface area.
* No edges, hence no weak points.

### Worst Qualities

* Impractical to hold or place on table.
* Expensive to manufacture.
* Low packing volume / surface area ratio.
